Statement:
 The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 
 12+22+...+102=385
 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

 (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

 Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

 sum of natural numbers and sum of their squares have well known formulas, just used those.
