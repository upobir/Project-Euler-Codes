/*
Notes:
 we basically just find all products of len digit numbers and check if they are palindromes, we however do it from reverse to find the
 largest product faster and stop when product can no longer be larger. Using property of 3 digit product, the answer can be optimized more,
 but did not use it.
 Complexity: O(10^(2n))
