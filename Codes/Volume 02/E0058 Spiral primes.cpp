Statment:
 Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
 
 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
 39 18  5  4  3 12 29
 40 19  6  1  2 11 28
 41 20  7  8  9 10 27
 42 21 22 23 24 25 26
 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
 
 It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 
 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
 
 If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is 
 continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

/*
Notes:
 We know the formula to find the numbers on diagonal from 0028, so we just add a layer of number and check how many primes are added. But
 since the numbers can be large we need faster prime checker, so I used randomized rabin miller, although there is a faster version of 
 rabin miller, I used randomized version for sake of generality.
 Complexity: O(X * log X * t)
